# RickRollC
A very simple rickroll program to rickroll someone. Upon execution, it would display Rick Astley's Never gonna let you up full lyrics at once - giving the victem the sense of being rickrolled. To run it, just click the green Code button > Download ZIP > Extract then double click the .exe file. The .c file is the source code and isn't necessary for the .exe to run. Both files can be renamed and moved without corruption or anything.
